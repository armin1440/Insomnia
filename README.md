# Insomnia
Advanced Programming Midterm Project
This app is similar to postman app. It shows you the response of the given request. As it's a student project it's not perfect ;)
You can enter an url to the text field at the top and choose a method from the list next to the url field. You can also set headers and message bodies below the url field.
After that press the send button and now you can see its raw response in the raw field.
You can also save your requests (just request not its response) by pressing the save button next to the send button.
In the menu you can toggle the app to full screen mode, hide it in system tray (by ticking the hide box in the options menu) and read about the app and me :).
The follow redirect option is not implemented so it does not work.
